# ETL Project - The Joy of Painting

## Project Context

In this project, we will explore the concept of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), which involves taking data from multiple unique sources, modifying it, and then storing it in a centralized database. The goal is to collect data from various formats such as CSV, JSON, XML, API requests, etc., and create a database that allows viewers to filter 403 episodes of "The Joy of Painting" based on specific criteria.

## Presented Problem

The local public broadcasting station has received numerous requests for information on "The Joy of Painting." To cater to their viewers, they want a website that enables users to filter 403 episodes using the following criteria:

1. **Month of Original Broadcast:** Viewers can filter episodes based on the month they were originally broadcast, allowing them to watch paintings from specific times of the year.

2. **Subject Matter:** Viewers can filter episodes based on the specific items that were painted, enabling them to find episodes of interest.

3. **Color Palette:** Viewers can filter episodes based on the specific colors used in a painting, allowing them to watch episodes with their preferred color schemes.

The broadcasting station has collected data from various sources, but it is currently spread across multiple files and formats, making it unusable in its current state. They have also hired another team to build a front-end for filtering episodes, and now they seek your expertise in designing and building a database to house this data and creating an API to access it.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Extract and gather data from multiple sources related to "The Joy of Painting" episodes.

2. Transform the collected data into a structured format suitable for storage in a centralized database.

3. Load the transformed data into the designed database.

4. Build an API to allow viewers to access and filter episodes based on different criteria.

- SQL (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)
- Flask (for API development)
- Pandas (for data manipulation and transformation)
